- Keep shared navigation in the root route and the three visitor experiences on separate routes, because each screen has its own purpose and shareable URL.
- Use one reusable React Three Fiber globe for both exploration screens, because both need the same realistic Mars surface and orbit interaction.
- Serve uploaded photographs and downloaded texture through asset pointers, because media should not bloat the source repository.
